	    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It includes both auxiliary and input-related memory usage. An example of space complexity is O(n), which means the memory required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
